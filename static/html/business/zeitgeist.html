    Mneme product is a proof of concept project which aims to mimic the communication process and help people develop and improve their 
    communication process by practising memory. Analytics and data science behavioural tracking allow the user to analyse their performance, memory and their body language while exercising. 
    One part of the technology is founded on the latest natural language processing research which is founded on the usage of large language models for generating text, voice cloning, text recognition and creation of realistic dialogues with the internal AI. 
    Another part of the technology is focused on computer vision body posture detection, motion tracking and facial expression in order to score or recommend improvements in 
    body language performance. The system uses various incentivization methods in order to enhance the coaching experience, hook the student to the process and commit him to the lifestyle and process
    of continuous learning and development.
